# SimplePendulum
Visualize Simple Pendulum Motion In Python with Pygame.
The inspiration to make Simple Pendulum came from "The Coding Train Coding Challenge #159" link- https://youtu.be/NBWMtlbbOag
In the youtube video the code is written in P5.js.
I have used Python with Pygame to get the same results. Have fun !!!
